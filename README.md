# Hi there 👋

## Who am I?

My name is Jeremie Drouet, a french 🥖 developer.

I'm a 🦀 software engineer @datadog working on [Vector](https://github.com/timberio/vector/).

## What I'm working on, on my free time?

- [mrml](https://github.com/jdrouet/mrml), [catapulte](https://github.com/jdrouet/catapulte) and [jolimail](https://github.com/jdrouet/jolimail): a transactionnal email suite, not to rely on american paid services.
- [codebench](https://www.codebench.cloud/): a platform to keep track of your benchmarks (used by [mrml](https://github.com/jdrouet/mrml)).
- [tekitoi](https://github.com/jdrouet/tekitoi): an lightweight, opensource and simple to use alternative to [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) and [Keycloak](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak).

Those projects are motivated by the lack of privacy 👀 or the carbon footprint of the existing alternatives 🌍.

With the current climate changes, it's the developer's duty to build lightweight and energy efficient softwares.

Rust is really lightweight compared to NodeJS (look at [mrml](https://github.com/jdrouet/mrml) compared to [mjml](https://mjml.io)), Python or Java (look at the requirements from [Keycloak](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak)).
