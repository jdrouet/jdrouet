# Hi there 👋

## Who am I?

My name is Jeremie Drouet, a french 🥖 developer.

I'm a senior 🦀 software engineer.

## What I'm working on, on my free time?

- [mrml](https://github.com/jdrouet/mrml): a Rust 🦀 rewrite of [mjml](https://mjml.io/) that boosts performances.
- [git-metrics](https://github.com/jdrouet/git-metric): a git extension to store metrics related to your project, written in Rust 🦀.

Those projects are motivated by the lack of privacy 👀 or the carbon footprint of the existing alternatives 🌍.

With the current climate changes, it's the developer's duty to build lightweight and energy efficient softwares.

Rust is really lightweight compared to NodeJS (look at [mrml](https://github.com/jdrouet/mrml) compared to [mjml](https://mjml.io)).
